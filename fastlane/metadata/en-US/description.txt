Never forget a name again.

Remember helps you build stronger connections by actually remembering the people you meet.

HOW IT WORKS
• Meet someone new and record a quick voice note describing them
• The app generates an abstract sketch from your description as a visual memory anchor
• Spaced repetition flashcards help you recall their name over time

FEATURES
• Voice-first input — describe what you noticed about them
• AI-generated memory sketches as visual anchors
• Smart review scheduling that adapts to your recall
• Apple Watch companion for quick adds on the go
• Search and manage everyone you've met

PERFECT FOR
• Professionals who meet lots of people at networking events, conferences, or sales calls
• People who struggle with names but remember faces and details
• Anyone tired of the "I'm so bad with names" excuse

It's the app for people who care enough about others to remember them.
